# Task Description

## Coding Challenge - The Cheapest Stopover
You're a jetsetting high flyer who is nearly always on the move. You often end up sleeping in airports due to poor flight connections. Your task is to build an application to find the cheapest hotel near an airport on a particular date. This will allow you to spend more time in a comfy bed and less time on the airport floor!

## Specific Goal
Build a simple server that, given a city code (eg, PAR), check-in date, and check-out date, will return the three cheapest hotel rooms. Make sure your output only contains the required information, the name of the hotel, address, phone number, and the rate for the room.

Please provide instructions on how to build and execute your project.
